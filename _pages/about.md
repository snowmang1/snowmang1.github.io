Hello, my name is Evan Drake.
I am a computer science researcher among other things.
I enjoy writing about my hobbies be that research or about some of the interesting books I read.
I graduated in 2024 with my masters (my thesis can be found below),
and currently I am taking a break from academic study but I plan on returning for my PhD in the coming years.
To stay sharp I decided to start writing about some of the research side quests I have been doing.
This website includes both a blog for less formal writings (usually) and a projects tab where you can find some of my ongoing projects.
I will try to post news about both my interests and some interesting books/publications I read.
